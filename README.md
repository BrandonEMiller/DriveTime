DriveTime
=========

A calendar application that factors in the time it will take to get to events during the scheduling process

See it here: http://brandonemiller.github.io/DriveTime/

This is my final project as part of my time in the Front End Engineering Program at The Iron Yard Academy.

Utilized in this application is the Google Maps API. Information about the Google Maps API can be found at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial.

Plugins used include parsley.js, pickadate.js, and FullCalendar. 

Parsley.js is a form validation plugin used to check over the inputs for event creations.  Find more at http://parsleyjs.org/documentation.html

pickadate.js is a great tool for users to input dates and times.  Find more at http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/

FullCalendar provides a great calendar vizualization for application. Find more at http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/

Future goals for this project include:
  - Creating user log in and user based save data for events.
  - Integration with Google Calendar
  - Use of Google Time Zone to calculate cross time zone scheduling
  - Drive Time estimates to be affected by typical travel patterns for the times requested.
  - Responsive Design (Completed on November 20th, 2013)
