A calendar application that factors in the time it will take to get to events during the scheduling process

This is my final project as part of my time in the Front End Engineering Program at The Iron Yard Academy.

Utilized in this application is the Google Maps API. Information about the Google Maps API can be found at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial.

Plugins used include pickadate.js and FullCalendar. 

pickadate.js is a great tool for users to input dates and times.  Find more at http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/

FullCalendar provides a great calendar vizualization for application. Find more at http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
