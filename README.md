DriveTime
=========

A calendar application that factors in the time it will take to get to events during the scheduling process

See it here: http://brandonemiller.github.io/DriveTime/

This is my final project as part of my time in the Front End Engineering Program at The Iron Yard Academy.

Utilized in this application is the Google Maps API. Information about the Google Maps API can be found at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial.

Plugins used include pickadate.js and FullCalendar. 

pickadate.js is a great tool for users to input dates and times.  Find more at http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/

FullCalendar provides a great calendar vizualization for application. Find more at http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/

Future goals for this project include:
  - Creating user log in and user based save data for events.
  - Integration with Google Calendar
  - Drive Time estimates to be affected by typical travel patterns for the times requested.
  - Responsive Design
